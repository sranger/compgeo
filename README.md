# compgeo
This is a library I created initially for the Computational Geometry class at the Rochester Institute of Technology taught by Professor Reynold Bailey. I took the class while working on my Masters of Science in Computer Science.

This library contains algorithms for Convex Hulls, Delaunay triangulation, segment intersections, trapezoidal maps, and the implementations of the class assignments.
